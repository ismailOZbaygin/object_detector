# object_detector
This project about detecting objects, animals and human parts with opencv. YoloV4 is used for detecting animals.


# Important warning for yolo direction

To run the code properly, you need to download the following YOLO files:

- `coco.names`  
- `yolov4.cfg`  
- `yolov4.weights`  

Place these files in the same directory as your script (or update the paths accordingly) so that the model can load correctly.

## Download YOLO Files

You only need to grab these three files and place them in your `yolo/` folder:

- [`coco.names`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/data/coco.names)  
- [`yolov4.cfg`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg)  
- [`yolov4.weights`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4.weights)
