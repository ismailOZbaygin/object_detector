# object_detector
This project about detecting objects, animals and human parts with opencv. YoloV4 is used for detecting animals.


# Important warning for yolo direction

To run the code properly, you need to download the following YOLO files:

- `coco.names`  
- `yolov4.cfg`  
- `yolov4.weights`  

Place these files in the same directory as your script (or update the paths accordingly) so that the model can load correctly.
